# BTC-DL: Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview

BTC-DL is a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook designed for brain tumor classification using deep learning techniques. The project leverages a publicly available dataset and provides a framework for training, evaluating, and modifying the model to suit custom requirements.

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: [Brain Tumor Dataset](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/articles/1512427/versions/8)
Source Link: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427

## How to Use

1. **No Need to Download the Dataset:** You do not need to download and extract the dataset using the provided link, as all the downloading processes are integrated in the Jupyter notebook.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:** Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells. The notebook is designed to automatically execute the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. **Customise the Code:** Users can modify the dataset paths, model architecture, and hyperparameters as needed to train with different images or models.

## Customization

* The code is modular, allowing easy modification of the dataset path, image preprocessing steps, and model architecture.
* Users can adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs to optimize performance.
* Additional data augmentation and advanced preprocessing techniques can be incorporated to improve model accuracy.

## Requirements (latest libraries)

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* TensorFlow or PyTorch
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## License

This project is open-source and available for customization and further development.
